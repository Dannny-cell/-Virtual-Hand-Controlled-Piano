# ðŸŽ¹ Virtual-Hand-Controlled-Piano
This project is a real-time, hand-gesture-controlled virtual piano application built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It transforms the user's webcam feed into an interactive instrument, allowing notes to be played by bending the fingertips over the projected on-screen keys.
